This project implements a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) designed to estimate a student's final academic score based on multiple performance indicators such as midterm grades, project work, and assignments.
By applying fuzzy logic, the system handles uncertainty and subjectivity in evaluation, providing a more flexible and human-like decision-making approach compared to rigid scoring formulas.
